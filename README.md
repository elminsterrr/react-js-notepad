# react-js-notepad
A notepad (client + server) created with: ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS and MongoDB.

This is a CRUD application working with notes. First a RESTful API server was created (using NodeJS and Express) to act as an interface for querying and persisting data in a MongoDB database. When creating or editing notes the userâ€™s input is checked by Redux-Form for the right data. All requests and connection errors are handled by Redux-Thunk middleware.

You can see it live here: [Heroku](https://react-js-notepad.herokuapp.com/)
